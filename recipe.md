Put the aubergine into a large bowl and toss with the olive oil. Heat a non-stick frying pan over a high heat and tip in the aubergine. Cook, tossing regularly, for 5 minutes or until the aubergine is charred. Tip into a bowl.

STEP 2

Turn down the heat and fry the onion with a splash of water for 5 minutes or until translucent (add a little water if it starts to catch). Add the garlic and chilli, and cook for 2 minutes, then tip in the tomatoes and ½ a tin of water. Season well and use a masher to break up the large tomato pieces. Tip the aubergine back in and simmer gently for 20-30 minutes or until thickened and the aubergine is soft.

STEP 3

Cook the pasta following pack instructions, then drain well, reserving some of the cooking water. Tip the pasta into the sauce and toss well, adding a little pasta water if it’s too thick. Add ¾ of the cheese and toss well, divide between bowls then top with the remaining cheese and the basil.
